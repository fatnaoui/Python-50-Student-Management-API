In this mini project, you'll see in action how API works using RestAPI fraework in Django.
We are gonna create 2 models: a Student class and an Institute class with one to many relationship.
Then we're gonna serialise our objects using the model serialisers from rest_framework.
After that, we are gonna try to do CRUD operations using Postman.
